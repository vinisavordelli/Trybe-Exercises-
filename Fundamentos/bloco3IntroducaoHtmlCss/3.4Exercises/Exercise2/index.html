        <h2>Do you know the Mantis Shrimp? Well, you should! Let me introduce you this Beast!! </h1>
          <p>First, let me tell you some boring scientific stuff, the mantis shrimp scientific name is Odontodactylus scyllarus, next we'll be able to see more scientific info about it:</p>
            
          <ul style="display: block;">
              <il>Kingdom: Animalia</il><br>
              <il>Phylum: Arthropoda</il><br>
              <il>Subphylum:Crustacea</il><br>
              <il>Class: Malacostraca</il><br>
              <il>Subclass: Opoclarida</il><br>
              <il>Order: Stomatopoda</il><br>
            </ul>
           
        <h3>Now to the cool stuff</h3>
        <p> Have you seen a Guillermo Del Toro movie and got impressed by the color used? <br>
            Or have you ever looked at someone and said : <br> 
            - Hey you are really tough! <br>
          
            
            If so, let me tell you, the Mantis Shrimp would laugh at you, let me tell you why!

        <section id="Fact number 1">
          <h3> This MOFO can see EVERYTHING!!!!</h3>
          <p>Let me tell you something, the ammount of colors a species can see is determined by the ammount of color-receptive cones your eyes have. And we think we are superior than dogs because they only Have 2 cone receptor while we have 3. Meanwhile a Mantis Shrimp Laughs of your insignificance while startig at you and actually seeing UV Radiation consume you.  
          This little dude has <strong> 16 color-receptive cones!!</strong> It probably can see your biggest fears and use it against you.

          <h3>One Punch Man is a Shrimp</h3>
          <p>
        When you think of someone strong you think of whom? Eddie Hall?<br>
        And someone who could throw a punch? Muhammad Ali? Mike Tyson? <br>
        If the Mantis Shrimp was the size of a human being not only would he beat all those 3 without breaking a sweat but he also would be the bringer of armageddon. <br>
        This dude punches so fast and so strong water around its punch boils, reaching <strong>4400 celsius degrees </strong>if we could accelerate our arms at 1/10th of the speed this shrimp can we would be able to launch small objects into orbit. <br>
        And you think it stops there? Its punch is so strong that sends a shockwave that gets so hot that it emits light for a brief moment! If you still don't get how absurd that is, imagine if it was in a boxing fight, it would punch you, and even if it missed it would kill you. 
         </p>

          <p> Seriously, you cannot survive an ecounter with this beast, they are aggressive, run, take your children and run as fast as you can, but keep in mind that if you're underwater <strong>nothing will be able to save your soul</strong>.</p>
